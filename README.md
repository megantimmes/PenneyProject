### An Overview of Penney's Game and Two Variations of the Humble-Nishiyama Version

In Penney's Game, two players choose a sequence of heads and tails where the sequence has a length of 3. The player who chooses second must choose a different sequence from that of the player who chooses first. In the game, a fair coin is flipped as many times as is necessary until 3 consecutive flips match the sequence of one of the players, who is the winner of the game. As the coin can be flipped infinitely many times until a player has won, draws are not possible in Penney's game.

In the original variation of the Humble-Nishiyama version, the fair coin is replaced with a standard deck of 52 cards. Instead of picking a sequence of length 3 of heads and tails, players pick separate sequences of black cards and red cards. Like in Penney's Game, cards are drawn from the deck of 52 cards until the colors of 3 consecutive cards match the chosen sequence of one of the players, who is the winner of that "trick." However, unlike in Penney's Game, after 1 trick has been scored, cards are drawn again until no cards remain in the deck. The players are not allowed to change their sequences during the game. Once all cards have been drawn, the player who has won the most tricks is the winner of the game. As it is possible for the players to have won the same number of tricks from a finite deck, the players may draw the original variation of the Humble-Nishiyama version.

In Ron's variation of the Humble-Nishiyama version, cards are drawn as in the original variation. In addition, as in the original variation, when the colors of 3 consecutive cards match the chosen sequence of one of the players, that player wins that hand. Again, the game proceeds until no cards remain in the deck. However, unlike the original variation of the Humble-Nishiyama version, in Ron's version, players do not win or lose the game based on the number of tricks won. Instead, they each count up the cumulative number of cards across the hands they won, and the player who has the most cards is the winner of the game. As it is possible for the players to have won the same number of cards from a finite deck, the players may draw Ron's variation of the Humble-Nishiyama version.
